<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great Document editors present however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs to help writing document on chemistry

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:
